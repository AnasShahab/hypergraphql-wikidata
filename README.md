# graphql-sparql-java
This is a working repository for a GraphQL server over a SPARQL endpoint, implemented in Java.

The server runs at http://localhost:8890 and for testing purposes is currently pointing to the following SPARQL endpoint: 
http://zbw.eu/beta/sparql/stw/query

For better experience, you can install the GraphiQL IDE extension for Chrome and point it to http://localhost:8890. 
See: ChromiQL, available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromeiql/fkkiamalmpiidkljmicmjfbieiclmeij?hl=en

A valid JSON-LD object is attached in the "extensions" section of the GraphQL response, as the value of the "json-ld" property.
